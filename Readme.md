# Avent of Code 2022

It's that time of the year again. Time to attempt Advent of Code. Like some of my previous years, I will be using Cloure. In addition to solving the problems with Clojure I may showcase using some of my favorite libraries if I think they are a good fit for the problem.

Generally I write a few functions (input parsing, logic) and unit test them (see the `test/` directory) and solve the actual problem in a comment block at the bottom of the file.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
